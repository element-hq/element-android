/**
 * In some cases, events may wish to reference other events.
 * This could be to form a thread of messages for the user to follow along with,
 * or to provide more context as to what a particular event is describing.
 * Relation are used to associate new information with an existing event.
 *
 * Relations are events which have an m.relates_to mixin in their contents,
 * and the new information they convey is expressed in their usual event type and content.
 *
 * Three types of relations are defined, each defining different behaviour when aggregated:
 *
 *  m.annotation - lets you define an event which annotates an existing event.
 *                  When aggregated, groups events together based on key and returns a count.
 *                  (aka SQL's COUNT) These are primarily intended for handling reactions.
 *
 *  m.replace - lets you define an event which replaces an existing event.
 *             When aggregated, returns the most recent replacement event. (aka SQL's MAX)
 *             These are primarily intended for handling edits.
 *
 *  m.reference - lets you define an event which references an existing event.
 *              When aggregated, currently doesn't do anything special, but in future could bundle chains of references (i.e. threads).
 *              These are primarily intended for handling replies (and in future threads).
 *
 *  m.thread - lets you define an event which is a thread reply to an existing event.
 *             When aggregated, returns the most thread event
