        ### Before the release

        - [ ] Weblate sync, fix lint issue if any (in a dedicated PR)
        - [ ] Check the update of the store descriptions (using Google Translate if necessary) to ensure that the changes are acceptable to be published to the stores.
        - [ ] While Weblate is locked, and after the PR from Weblate has been merged, handle all the TODOs in the main `strings.xml` file
        - [ ] Run the script `./tools/release/pushPlayStoreMetaData.sh`. You can check in the GooglePlay console the Activity log to check the effect.

        ### Do the release

        - [ ] Create release with gitflow, branch name `release/1.2.3`
        - [ ] Check the crashes from the PlayStore

        - [ ] Run the integration test, and especially `UiAllScreensSanityTest.allScreensTest()`
        - [ ] Create an account on matrix.org and do some smoke tests that the sanity test does not cover like: 1-1 call, 1-1 video call, Jitsi call for instance
        - [ ] Run towncrier: `towncrier --version v1.2.3 --draft` (remove `--draft` do write the file CHANGES.md)
        - [ ] Check that the folder `changelog.d` is empty. It can happen that some remaining files stay here
        - [ ] Check the file CHANGES.md consistency. It's possible to reorder items (most important changes first) or change their section if relevant. Also an opportunity to fix some typo, or rewrite things
        - [ ] Add file for fastlane under ./fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs
        - [ ] (optional) Push the branch and start a draft PR (will not be merged), to check that the CI is happy with all the changes.
        - [ ] Finish release with gitflow, delete the draft PR (if created)
        - [ ] Push `main` and the new tag `v1.2.3` to origin

        - [ ] Copy the fastlane change to the GooglePlay console in the section en-GB.
        - [ ] Push to beta release to 100% of the users
        - [ ] Notify the F-Droid team so that they can schedule the publication on F-Droid
