## Debug signature

This folder contains a debug signature, and the debug build will uses this signature to build the APK.

The validity of the signature is 30 years. So it has to be replaced before June 2049 :).

More info about the debug signature: https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#debug-mode
