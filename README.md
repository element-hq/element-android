# Element Android P2P

Element Android P2P is an experimental version of the Element Android Matrix Client. Since it is experimental it is used for demo purposes only and breaking changes are expected between versions.

[Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite) and [Pinecone](https://github.com/matrix-org/pinecone) are leveraged to embed a Matrix homeserver into the app that uses peer-to-peer overlay routing for federation traffic.

The latest demo builds can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uK_BcHGiAYHkN6OAA7P73obAquwShRg5).
