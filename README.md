# RiotX Android

RiotX is an Android Matrix Client currently in beta but in active development.

It is a total rewrite of [Riot-Android](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-android) with a new user experience. RiotX will become the official replacement as soon as all features are implemented.

Nightly build: [![Buildkite](https://badge.buildkite.com/657d3db27364448d69d54f66c690f7788bc6aa80a7628e37f3.svg?branch=develop)](https://buildkite.com/matrix-dot-org/riotx-android/builds?branch=develop)

# New Android SDK

RiotX is based on a new Android SDK fully written in Kotlin (like RiotX). In order to make the early development as fast as possible, RiotX and the new SDK currently share the same git repository. We will make separate repos once the SDK is stable enough.


# Roadmap

The current target is to release an application out of beta with the same level of features (and even more) as Riot.
The roadmap has 3 phases:

- [phase 0](https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/labels/phase0): Prototyping / Project setup
- [phase 1](https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/labels/phase1): Beta release to the Play Store
- [phase 2](https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/labels/phase2): Out of beta
