  "intl_fmt": "+33 6 51 54 76 77",
  "success": true,
  "sid": "253299954",
  "submit_url": "https://homeserver.org/_matrix/client/unstable/add_threepid/msisdn/submit_token"
}
```

## User receive a text message

> Riot

> Your Riot validation code is 892541, please enter this into the app

### User enter the code to the app

#### Wrong code

> POST https://homeserver.org/_matrix/client/unstable/add_threepid/msisdn/submit_token

```json
{
  "sid": "253299954",
  "client_secret": "f1K29wFZBEr4RZYatu7xj8nEbXiVpr7J",
  "token": "111111"
}
```

400

```json
{
  "errcode": "M_UNKNOWN",
  "error": "Error contacting the identity server"
}
```

This is not an ideal, but the client will display a hint to check the entered code to the user.

#### Correct code

> POST https://homeserver.org/_matrix/client/unstable/add_threepid/msisdn/submit_token

```json
{
  "sid": "253299954",
  "client_secret": "f1K29wFZBEr4RZYatu7xj8nEbXiVpr7J",
  "token": "892541"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

Then the app call `https://homeserver.org/_matrix/client/r0/account/3pid/add` as per adding an email and follow the same UIS flow

This is the same request and response than to remove email, but with this body:

}
```

Note that the phone number is provided without `+`, but with the country code.
